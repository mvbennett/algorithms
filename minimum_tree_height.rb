# Given an undirected graph with N vertices and is a tree-like (meaning there are no cycles, no disconnected vertices or disjoined sets).
#
# If a vertex in the given graph is selected as a root node of a tree, there is an associated height. (The height of a tree is defined as the largest number of nodes in the path from the root to a leaf)
#
# Find the values of vertices, where the associated treeâ€™s height would be a minimum height. If there are ties for minimum, height, return all the values.
#
# There are N vertices, and vertices have values ranging from 0 to N-1
#
# Input:   Integer N denoting number of vertices
#        Array of Two-Item Integers representing edges
#
# Output: Array of Integers representing vertices with minimum height
